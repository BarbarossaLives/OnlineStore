# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Preparation
- [ ] All code is committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `requirements.txt` is up to date
- [ ] `render.yaml` is properly configured
- [ ] Environment variables are documented

### 2. Render Account Setup
- [ ] Render account is created and verified
- [ ] GitHub repository is connected to Render
- [ ] Payment method is added (if using paid plans)

## Deployment Steps

### 3. Create Services (Using Blueprint)
- [ ] Import `render.yaml` blueprint in Render
- [ ] Connect to your GitHub repository
- [ ] Review service configurations
- [ ] Deploy all services

### 4. Manual Service Creation (If not using blueprint)

#### Backend Service
- [ ] Create new Web Service
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Set environment: Python
- [ ] Set build command: `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh`
- [ ] Set start command: `chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh`
- [ ] Set health check path: `/admin/`

#### Database Service
- [ ] Create new PostgreSQL service
- [ ] Choose appropriate plan (Starter recommended)
- [ ] Note down connection details

#### Redis Service
- [ ] Create new Redis service
- [ ] Choose appropriate plan (Starter recommended)
- [ ] Note down connection URL

#### Frontend Service
- [ ] Create new Static Site
- [ ] Connect to GitHub repository
- [ ] Set build command: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
- [ ] Set publish directory: `frontend/.next`

### 5. Environment Variables Setup

#### Backend Service Variables
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` (auto-generated by Render)
- [ ] `DEBUG`: `false`
- [ ] `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: `.onrender.com`
- [ ] `POSTGRES_DB`: From PostgreSQL service
- [ ] `POSTGRES_USER`: From PostgreSQL service
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: From PostgreSQL service
- [ ] `POSTGRES_HOST`: From PostgreSQL service
- [ ] `POSTGRES_PORT`: `5432`
- [ ] `REDIS_URL`: From Redis service

#### Frontend Service Variables
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Your backend service URL

### 6. Service Dependencies
- [ ] Backend service is linked to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Backend service is linked to Redis
- [ ] Frontend service has access to backend URL

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 7. Health Checks
- [ ] Backend service is running (green status)
- [ ] Database connection is successful
- [ ] Redis connection is successful
- [ ] Frontend is accessible

### 8. Functionality Testing
- [ ] Admin panel is accessible (`/admin/`)
- [ ] GraphQL API is responding (`/graphql/`)
- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Static files are served correctly

### 9. Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Admin panel requires authentication
- [ ] Environment variables are not exposed

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### 10. Ongoing Tasks
- [ ] Monitor service logs regularly
- [ ] Check resource usage
- [ ] Set up alerts for service failures
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated

### 11. Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Watch Redis memory usage
- [ ] Consider upgrading plans if needed
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- [ ] Build failures - check Python/Node.js versions
- [ ] Database connection errors - verify environment variables
- [ ] Static file issues - check WhiteNoise configuration
- [ ] Memory issues - consider upgrading service plans

### Support Resources
- [ ] Render documentation
- [ ] Saleor documentation
- [ ] Django documentation
- [ ] Render community forums
